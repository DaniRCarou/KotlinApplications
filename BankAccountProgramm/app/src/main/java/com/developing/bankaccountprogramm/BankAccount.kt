    // 4. We have to create a variable which contains the transaction history, called 'transactionHistory'

    // 4.1 This will be a mutable list of Strings,
    // so we have to define the data type because if you donÂ´t define it, the list wouldn't know of which type it is, which is why it is used these brackets.

    // 4.2 Otherwise, it is possible not define the type if you wrote inside of the brackets. For example: private val transactionHistory = mutableListOf<>("")
    // By writing ' ("") ', I would indicate the list would contain a String data type.

    // 4.3 'private' keyword is used to change the accessibility of this variable.
    // So it is not possible to access transaction history,
    // because this variable is now not accessible to me from outside of the BankAccount class as it is private.
    // Thereby, the transactionHistory is safe and it is only possible to access it through the functions of the BankAccount class.
    // So it cannot be directly modified. It is  only possible through the functions.
    private val transactionHistory = mutableListOf<String>()

        transactionHistory.add("$accountHolder deposited $$amount") // The TransactionHistory is modified

    }

    // 2. Withdraw money

        if(amount <= balance ){

            // If the amount is less equal balance, then we can withdraw money

            balance -= amount // The amount attribute is modified. You can also write: balance = balance - amount

            transactionHistory.add("$accountHolder withdrew $$amount") // The TransactionHistory is modified


        } else{
